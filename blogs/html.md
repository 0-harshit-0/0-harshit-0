# HTML

- Let’s start with the full form: **HyperText Markup Language**.
- HTML is used to provide structure to a web page.
- This structure can be used to make a visually appealing and accessible site.
- This structure can also be used by machines/servers/algorithms to understand a site, because they can’t _“see”_ or _“use”_ a page the way humans do they infer meaning from structure (HTML mostly) and presentation cues (CSS).


## Tags

- Tags are the basic building blocks of HTML. HTML uses tags to structure and describe content (for example, `<p>`, `<a>`, and `<div>`).

- Each tag has its own role and often comes with default browser styles. Here’s a quick-start list:
    - `<html>`   The root element that wraps the whole HTML document.
    - `<head>`   Holds metadata like the page title and other non-visible setup info.
    - `<body>`   Contains the visible content of the page.
    - `<div>`   A generic block container used to group content (often for layout/styling).
    - `<h1>`   A top-level heading.
    - `<p>`   A paragraph of text.
- Check out https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.asp for an extensive list of tags.
- Although it’s possible to reset styles and build a whole page using just one tag (like `<div>`), machines can’t reliably understand the meaning of different parts of the page if everything is the same tag. For example, a common “everything is a div” structure looks like this:

```html
<div>
  <div>heading</div>
  <div>
    <div>nav1</div>
    <div>nav2</div>
    <div>nav3</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <div>topic heading 1</div>
  <div>
    <div>content</div>
  </div>

  <div>topic heading 2</div>
  <div>
    <div>content</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div>footer</div>
```

Now, this can look fine and you can style it, add animations, etc., but the machine sees only one thing everywhere (i.e., `<div>`). It will try to infer structure using other signals, but not having meaningful tags can lead to issues.
